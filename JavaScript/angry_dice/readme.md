# Angry Dice Game
A JavaScript / JQuery-based interactive game for one player. 

The game has 3 rounds. The object is to be the first to six by rolling your dice in ascending order pairs. A player has two dice they can roll and they can lock a die, if it rolls to something they will need. The game requires the player to start at the beginning if they ever roll double Angry Faces (the 3).
