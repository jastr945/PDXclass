# Weather Forecast App
This JavaScript-based app downloads weather data from the OpenWeatherMap dataset by using its API. JQuery Ajax call is made to access weather description, temperature, humidity, wind speed and other related data for a given location. 

The widget shows an appropriated weather icon based on a weather code located in the JSON dictionary. The backgroung image changes according to the weather description.

Several CSS media queries were used for responsiveness.

I wrote this app during the 5th week of the PDX Code Guild developer bootcamp, in order to practice JavaScript and working with APIs.
