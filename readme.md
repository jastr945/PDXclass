# PDX Code Guild labs & projects
This repository contains the labs and projects, which I created during the **12-weeks Python-based developer bootcamp**, covering Python, Django, JavaScript & JQuery, database design, HTML, SASS and CSS.
### Python folder
I worked on these labs during the first 4 weeks of the bootcamp. The main topics include:
- Python data structures (lists, dictionaries, objects, etc.)
- Python built-in functions
- Creating **API** requests and handling responses 
- Regular Expressions (ReGex)
- using SQLite3 database in Python
### Javascript folder
Contains my **JavaScript** and **JQuery** labs, including interractive games, plenty of practice with selectors, event listeners, JavaScript classes, timing functions and animations.
### CSS and HTML folder
The folder contains some practice with **CSS flexbox**, **SASS** animations and mix-ins, and **HTML5**.
### Capstone (animal project) folder
This folder contains the code and documents for my final capstone. The aim of the project was to create a Django-based searchable database for an animal shelter. It took me **less than 2 weeks** to finish the MVP, and the project passed successfully, helping me to become a graduate of the PDX Code Guild.
### Portfolio
This is a **Django-based personal website**, where you can view the demos of several projects that I created at the bootcamp.
